//This is an abstract implementation of a Shoot Device class of objects.
//Shoot Devices should pool ammunition they shoot with.
//It has been given a degree of movement for aiming.
//Loading. setting up and accessing ammunition pool is mostly generic and has a virtual implementation to be overriden as required.
//How a shooting device performs the action is specific to the device and hence has an abstract implementation.
